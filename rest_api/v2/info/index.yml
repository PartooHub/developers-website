  # Getting started
  Here is the documentation on Partoo Rest API. It is maint for querying and updating data in Partoo database using `JSON` format.

  ## Purposes
  Partoo Rest API can be used for many differents purposes:
    - Retrieve data on businesses if you are a **publisher**
    - Manage your businesses/users if you are a **client**
    - Create/Subscribe/Manage organisations, users & businesses if you are a **reseller**
    - ...

  # Resources structure
  Partoo data is organised around 5 main resources:
  1. **Provider:** A provider represents the entity that signs the contract with the client using Partoo solution & products.
  An obvious example of provider is Partoo itself but a provider can also be a reseller of Partoo solutions.
  A provider owns `organisations`, `businesses`, `users` and `groups`. If you are a Partoo reseller there will be a provider resource representing
  you inside Partoo app.
  2. **Organisation:** An organisation represents the legal entity, most likely a commercial company, that owns `businesses` (or listings).
  If you are a Partoo client there are one or several organisations representing your companies.
  An organisation belongs to a `provider`.
  3. **User:** A user can be a Partoo app user or Partoo API user.
  A user belongs to an `organisation` and has a `role` which gives him different levels of access on the different resources on Partoo (see section below).
  4. **Business:** A business represents a listing. It belongs to an `organisation`
  5. **Group:** A group contains businesses, each organisation can have several groups of businesses.

  # Resources access

  ## Roles
  To use Partoo Rest API, you need an `api_key` (see authentication section). An `api_key` authenticates a user and each user has a `role`.

  A `role` defines for each resource (for instance `user`) a`READ` and/or `WRITE` access with the scope on which this access can be used.

  For instance a user with `BUSINESS_MANAGER` role has `WRITE` access on its own user and `READ` acces to all the users of its organisation.

  For now there are 4 roles available:
    - `PROVIDER` role is meant for reseller admin user. It can manage organisations, users and businesses of a provider
    - `ORG_ADMIN` role is meant for client admin user. It can manage the user and businesses of its organisation
    - `GROUP_MANAGER` role is meant for client group manager. It can manage several businesses and users that belong to the group he managed
    - `BUSINESS_MANAGER` role is meant for client business manager. It can manage several businesses, only if these businesses are in the same group.
    - `PUBLISHER` role is meant for publisher wanting to use Partoo as a data source. It can read Partoo businesses subscribed to presence management product
