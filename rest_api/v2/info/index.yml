  # Introduction
  The Partoo Rest API allows you to automate all the actions that are possible to do in the Partoo Web Application.

  The Partoo Rest API can be used for many different purposes:
    - Create/update/delete your businesses & users if you are a client.
    - Create/subscribe/manage organisations, businesses & users if you are a reseller.
    - Retrieve data on businesses you have access to if you are a publisher.
    - ...

  # JS SDK
  To know how to integrate Partoo in a white label mode using our JS SDK, please check our [JS SDK documentation](/js_sdk/).

  # Getting started

  ## Security Disclaimer
  **The Partoo Rest API is meant to be used only from a server that you control.** The API Key should **never** be transmitted
  to the front-end, and should be kept secret.
  If you need to make calls from a front-end, you should proxy them by a server that you control, that will add the API Key.

  ## Environments
  We provide two public environments, **Sandbox** and **Production**.
  - **Sandbox** is a playground environment for you to test your API integration without having to worry about side effects.
  - **Production** is where your "real" data should live. Changes made there are propagated to publishers.

  Some functionalities are disabled in Sandbox, to avoid having a production impact:
  - Business data will not be sent to the different publishers such as GMB, Facebook, etc.
  - It's not possible to import GMB and Facebook account listings.
  - There's no real reviews data, or real analytics data. The account starts empty, but can be filled by fake data if needed. For this, contact you Partoo Account Manager.

  ## First steps
  First, it's a good idea to start building and testing your integration in the Sandbox environment.

  Ask your Partoo Account Manager to send you an API Key for Sandbox. You'll need to pass this API Key in all your API calls in order
  to be authentified, in the header `x-APIKey`. More details in the <a href="#section/Authentication">Authentication section</a>.

  From there, you can call any route that your user has access to. To know the exact API endpoint to use, you can click
  on the route url above the "Response samples", and this will give you the urls for Production and Sandbox.

  If you need a UI access to Sandbox, ask your Partoo Account Manager for one. Be aware, Sandbox environment is empty by default,
  and has limited functionalities.

  Once you're confident that your integration is production ready, ask your Partoo Account Manager for a user access in Production,
  and to give you access to the API Key Manager tool. From there, you'll be able to generate and manage your own API Keys inside the Partoo Web Application.

  You can now use the Production API Key to start calling the Production API.

  # Resources and roles

  ## Resources structure
  Partoo data is organised around 5 main resources:
  1. **Provider:** A provider represents the entity that signs the contract with the client using Partoo solution & products.
  An obvious example of provider is Partoo itself but a provider can also be a reseller of Partoo solutions.
  A provider owns `organisations`, `businesses`, `users` and `groups`. If you are a Partoo reseller there will be a provider resource representing
  you inside Partoo app.
  2. **Organisation:** An organisation represents the legal entity, most likely a commercial company, that owns `businesses` (or listings).
  If you are a Partoo client there are one or several organisations representing your companies.
  An organisation belongs to a `provider`.
  3. **User:** A user can be a Partoo app user or Partoo API user.
  A user belongs to an `organisation` and has a `role` which gives him different levels of access on the different resources on Partoo (see section below).
  4. **Business:** A business represents a listing. It belongs to an `organisation`
  5. **Group:** A group contains businesses, each organisation can have several groups of businesses.

  ## Roles
  To use Partoo Rest API, you need an `api_key` (see authentication section). An `api_key` authenticates a user and each user has a `role`.

  A `role` defines for each resource (for instance `user`) a`READ` and/or `WRITE` access with the scope on which this access can be used.

  For instance a user with `BUSINESS_MANAGER` role has `WRITE` access on its own user and `READ` acces to all the users of its organisation.

  For now there are 5 roles available:
    - `PROVIDER` role is meant for reseller admin user. It can manage organisations, users and businesses of a provider
    - `ORG_ADMIN` role is meant for client admin user. It can manage the user and businesses of its organisation
    - `GROUP_MANAGER` role is meant for client group manager. It can manage several businesses and users that belong to the group he managed
    - `BUSINESS_MANAGER` role is meant for client business manager. It can manage several businesses, only if these businesses are in the same group.
    - `PUBLISHER` role is meant for publisher wanting to use Partoo as a data source. It can read Partoo businesses subscribed to presence management product
