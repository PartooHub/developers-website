    All the operations you can perform on organisation.
    An organisation is an entreprise that owns businesses.
- name: Businesses
  description: >
    <p>A <code>business</code> object contains all the details related to a local store. All the businesses created will be grouped under your <code>organisation</code>. The organisation is created at the onboarding phase, by Partoo.
    <p>In this section, is explained how a business can be created, updated or retrieved.
    <p>⚠️ <b>What are Custom fields ?</b>
    <p>Custom Fields allow Enterprise Administrators to add custom data fields to Partoo / Localoo under different formats (List, Text, Number…) in order to create a central datahub for local information and to:
    <li> Use this data to automatically feed other tools (Store locator, website, CRM, Chatbot...) from Partoo / Localoo
    <li>Allow local users to fill custom fields in order to transmit data from local to central
    <p>The APIs will allow you only to read the already defined permissions, the creation and editing APIs will be enabled at a later date (or say why they can't Post and Put them)
    <p>They can be configured at an org level only through contacting your dedicated Customer Success Manager.
    <p>Once created, Custom Fields values can be updated like any other business field.
    <p>See business fields endpoints for more details about custom fields.
- name: Business Fields
  description: >
    These endpoints give you the list of all the fields that are available for the business / organization / provider, grouped by section.
    <p>A `section` corresponds to the tabs in the Business Edit view of    Partoo UI. **Examples:** *Coordinates, Description, Custom Fields...*
    <p>Each section contains an array of fields that are displayed within it. **Examples:** *Name, Country, Email...*
    <p>**For each field**, these endpoints give you the `permissions` for each fields, depending on your role:
    <li>`enabled` Your right to write on a field, given by roles less restricitves than yours.
    <li>`enabled_for_rubroles` The right to write on a field you give to roles more restrictives than yours.
    <p>**For example**:
    <li>If the user is **ORG_ADMIN**, `enabled_for_subroles` describes the permissions of the field for all the GROUP_MANAGER and BUSINESS_MANAGER of the given organization.
    <li>If the user is **PROVIDER**, `enabled_for_subroles` describes the permissions of the field for all the ORG_ADMIN, GROUP_MANAGER and BUSINESS_MANAGER of the given provider.
    <p>**For each `custom_fields`**, these endpoints also give you their `metadata`:
    <li>Type, id and order for all of them
    <li>Constraints such as minimum and maximum for a number or list of values for a select.
    <p>See the response schema below for more details about each type metadata.
