description: >
  This endpoint lets you update the list of businesses within a specific group.
  It replaces the previous list of businesses with a new one.
  The new list can be directly specified using `business__in` parameter or built through a set of filters.
  You need to have `WRITE` access on the organisation if you want to update the businesses.
