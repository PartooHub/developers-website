summary: Delete organisation
description: >
  This endpoint lets you delete an organisation.
  You need to have `WRITE` access on your provider.
  When an organisation gets deleted all the resources linked to it are deleted (users and businesses).
  If the organisation still has businesses or users,
  it would raise an error if you do not indicate `force="True"` in the JSON body.
